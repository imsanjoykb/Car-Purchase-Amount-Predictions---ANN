<i>It's a Basic Deep Learning Project using Artificial Neural Network.</i><br> 

## Problem Statement 
We are supposed to develop a predictive model which will predict the Total Amount in Dollars that the customers are willing to pay to purchase a Car given the following attributes: Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt, Net Worth.

## The Task
To Predict the Total Amount in Dollars that they're going to pay for a Car. <br>
This a Classic Regression Problem and I've developed this model using Artificial Neural Network with 3 Dense Layer Model in a Sequential Manner. Here, The Optimizer being used is <b>"Adam"</b> and loss is measured with accordance to <b>"mean_squared_error"</b>.<br> 
  
## Technological Stack

 Language: Python <br>
 Platform: Google Colab <br>
 Framework: Tensorflow (v1.x) <br>
